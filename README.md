## Background

### What's myopic control in childrenÔºü

Myopia (or nearsightedness) is very common. One out of two people (50%) have it. With myopia, the eye is longer than normal from front to back, or the cornea (the clear window at the front of the eye) is too steeply curved. This makes things that are far away from you look blurry. Myopia is corrected with glasses, contact lenses or surgery in some cases. Having myopia can increase your chances of having some eye problems later, like cataract, glaucoma and retinal detachment.

Studies show myopia is becoming more common among children. While there is no proven direct link, research suggests that children who spend more time indoors doing near-focused activities (such as computer work, video games, and reading) have higher rates of myopia than those who spend more time outdoors.

Doctors are looking at ways to slow the progression of myopia in children. While myopia cannot be reversed, the goal of treatment is to keep it from getting worse. This can protect a child‚Äôs eye health in the future, despite still needing to wear glasses or contact lenses.[1]
